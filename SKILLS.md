# SKILLS

This document defines reusable **skills** for working in `project-core-runner`.

## Purpose

Skills are lightweight, repeatable workflows that help contributors make consistent changes without violating module boundaries.

- **For developers**: use skills as implementation playbooks during feature work, bug fixes, and refactors.
- **For agents**: use skills as execution triggers to choose the right workflow, validations, and output format automatically.

## Skill entry template (required)

Every new or updated skill entry **must** use the template below with all headings present.

```md
## <Skill name>

### Intent
<What this skill is designed to achieve.>

### Scope boundaries
<What is in scope and explicitly out of scope.>

### Preconditions
<Required context, inputs, tools, or repository state before starting.>

### Steps
1. <Ordered action>
2. <Ordered action>
3. <Ordered action>

### Validation checklist
- [ ] <Check proving the change works as intended>
- [ ] <Check proving architecture/module boundaries are respected>
- [ ] <Check proving no regressions were introduced>

### Rollback/safety notes
- <How to back out safely if validation fails>
- <Any guardrails, feature flags, or migration cautions>

### Example invocation
<Concrete example showing how someone should trigger/use this skill>
```

### Review gate for skill entries

- Reject any skill PR/review item that omits one or more mandatory headings above.
- Reject entries that leave mandatory sections blank or with placeholder-only content.
- Reject entries without an actionable validation checklist.
- Require rollback/safety notes for any skill that changes assets, scripts, or module structure.

## Definition of done for skills

A skill is production-ready only when all items below are true:

- [ ] Uses the required template with all mandatory headings.
- [ ] Intent and scope boundaries are specific and non-overlapping with existing skills.
- [ ] Preconditions list concrete inputs/dependencies.
- [ ] Steps are deterministic, ordered, and implementable.
- [ ] Validation checklist is measurable and aligned to architectural rules.
- [ ] Rollback/safety notes explain a safe recovery path.
- [ ] Example invocation is realistic and maps to the documented trigger.
- [ ] Ownership is clear in the skill catalog entry.

## Skill maintenance policy

Every skill catalog entry must include and maintain:

- **Skill owner**: named team or person accountable for correctness and updates.
- **Last-reviewed date**: date of the most recent explicit review.
- **Review cadence**: expected review frequency (for example, every sprint or monthly).

### Staleness policy

- A skill is considered **stale** when it is not reviewed within its declared cadence.
- Stale skills must be marked with a deprecation note and replacement guidance (if available).
- Deprecated skills should include:
  - Date deprecated.
  - Reason for deprecation.
  - Replacement skill/reference, or explicit archival status when no replacement exists.
- Remove or archive obsolete skills only after replacement guidance has been documented to avoid workflow gaps.

### Architecture/process change requirement

- Any PR that changes project architecture, module boundaries, or contribution process **must update affected skills in the same PR**.
- Reviews should block architecture/process PRs when related skill entries are missing required updates.

## Skill catalog (grouped by module)

### Gameplay

| Name | Trigger (when to use) | Inputs required | Output artifact | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gameplay Feature Change | Adding or modifying runtime gameplay behavior (player, obstacles, pickups, gameflow, gameplay VFX). | Target gameplay module, user story/acceptance criteria, impacted scenes/prefabs. | Updated gameplay scripts/assets in `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/` (+ notes on validations). | Gameplay Team |

**Required checks**
- Lightweight static checks (required):
  - Compile-check touched gameplay scripts.
  - Verify serialized field null-guards in changed components.
  - Validate changed references stay within gameplay/public APIs (no UI/Services internals).
- Optional runtime checks (when scenes/prefabs are affected):
  - Play Mode smoke test for touched gameplay loop/path.
  - Quick scene/prefab sanity run to confirm bindings and event hookups.

**PR evidence to include**
- Files touched under `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/` (and any related assets/prefabs).
- Boundary checks performed (how UI/Services/Core interaction stays via events/interfaces/APIs).
- Migration notes if any touched legacy gameplay path was relocated.

**Failure handling**
- If local Unity/runtime dependencies are unavailable, still complete static checks and document skipped runtime checks with reason.
- Record exact missing dependency/tooling and provide the minimal follow-up command for maintainers to run in a full Unity environment.

**Do**
- Keep runtime gameplay orchestration inside Gameplay modules.
- Communicate with UI/Services/Core via events, interfaces, or explicit public APIs.
- Preserve prefab/scene bindings and null-guard serialized fields.

**Don't**
- Access UI/Services internal implementations directly.
- Introduce circular dependencies with sibling modules.
- Move gameplay logic into UI components.

### UI

| Name | Trigger (when to use) | Inputs required | Output artifact | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UI Tweak / Screen Update | Updating HUD, menus, popups, or other presentation behavior. | Target UI screen/component, UX requirement, relevant gameplay/service events. | Updated UI scripts/assets in `Assets/Scripts/UI/` with reactive event wiring. | UI Team |

**Required checks**
- Lightweight static checks (required):
  - Compile-check touched UI scripts.
  - Confirm UI only consumes public gameplay/service APIs or events.
  - Validate serialized references and inspector fields are null-guarded where needed.
- Optional runtime checks (when visual flows are impacted):
  - Play Mode smoke test for the updated screen/HUD flow.
  - Interaction sanity pass for the specific UI path changed.

**PR evidence to include**
- Files touched under `Assets/Scripts/UI/` and related UI assets/prefabs.
- Boundary checks proving no gameplay logic moved into UI and no module-internal reach-through.
- Migration notes if any touched legacy `ui/` path was relocated.

**Failure handling**
- If runtime/Play Mode cannot run in the current environment, include static-check output and explicitly mark runtime checks as pending.
- Document missing dependencies (Unity version/editor package/tool) and handoff steps.

**Do**
- Keep UI logic in `Assets/Scripts/UI/` and make it reactive to state/events.
- Consume gameplay/services through interfaces, events, or explicit APIs.
- Validate bindings so screens update without breaking inspector links.

**Don't**
- Put gameplay rules or gameflow decisions in UI code.
- Reach into Gameplay module internals.
- Couple UI directly to service implementation details.

### Services

| Name | Trigger (when to use) | Inputs required | Output artifact | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service Integration | Adding/changing external-facing integrations (ads, analytics, audio, notifications, monetisation). | Service API contract, environment/config keys, feature flag or call sites. | Updated service adapters/APIs in `Assets/Scripts/Services/` and integration notes. | Services Team |

**Required checks**
- Lightweight static checks (required):
  - Compile-check touched service scripts.
  - Verify API/interface surface remains explicit and call sites use public contracts.
  - Confirm no tight service-to-service coupling added in changed code.
- Optional runtime checks (when integration endpoints are testable):
  - Run module-scoped integration smoke path with sandbox/test credentials.
  - Validate fallback behavior for unavailable provider responses.

**PR evidence to include**
- Files touched in `Assets/Scripts/Services/` plus relevant config changes.
- Boundary checks (consumer access path, interface usage, coupling review).
- Migration notes if legacy `services/` or `monetisation/` code was relocated.

**Failure handling**
- If credentials, SDKs, or network access are unavailable, run static checks only and document blocked runtime checks.
- Capture what dependency is missing and provide reproducible commands/steps for maintainers.

**Do**
- Expose clear public APIs for service consumers.
- Keep integrations isolated to Services with explicit contracts.
- Use interface-driven access when reasonable.

**Don't**
- Create hidden global state unless justified and documented.
- Create tight service-to-service coupling.
- Access Gameplay/UI internals from services.

### Core

| Name | Trigger (when to use) | Inputs required | Output artifact | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cross-cutting Core Utility | Introducing or adjusting shared minimal utilities (localization, scene management, config, helpers). | Shared use case, consumer modules, non-goal boundaries. | Focused utility updates in `Assets/Scripts/Core/` with dependency rationale. | Core Maintainers |

**Required checks**
- Lightweight static checks (required):
  - Compile-check touched core utility scripts.
  - Confirm utility remains module-agnostic and not gameplay-specific.
  - Verify at least one real consumer still resolves through explicit API/event usage.
- Optional runtime checks (when behavior is observable):
  - Module-scoped smoke test in a consumer flow (e.g., localization/scene/config usage path).
  - Quick regression pass for the affected shared utility entry point.

**PR evidence to include**
- Files touched under `Assets/Scripts/Core/` and immediate consumer call sites.
- Boundary checks showing no module-internal leakage and no circular dependency introduction.
- Migration notes if legacy `localization/`, `scenemanagement/`, `config/`, or `settings/` paths were relocated.

**Failure handling**
- If consumer runtime validation cannot execute, provide static-check evidence and list unverified runtime paths.
- Note missing environment pieces and provide follow-up validation steps for maintainers.

**Do**
- Keep Core utilities minimal, shared, and module-agnostic.
- Prefer narrow APIs consumed through explicit interfaces/events.
- Confirm at least one real cross-module consumer.

**Don't**
- Turn Core into a dumping ground for unrelated logic.
- Add gameplay-specific logic to Core.
- Bypass module boundaries by exposing internals.

### Cross-cutting (refactor/migration)

| Name | Trigger (when to use) | Inputs required | Output artifact | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Refactor / Migration | Touching legacy module paths that should move toward `Gameplay/`, `UI/`, `Services/`, or `Core/`. | Legacy path being changed, target module destination, namespace/reference impact. | Scoped relocation + reference updates + migration summary. | Architecture Owners |

**Required checks**
- Lightweight static checks (required):
  - Compile-check moved/updated scripts and namespace/reference updates.
  - Verify relocation scope is limited to touched module(s) only.
  - Confirm no circular dependencies or module-boundary violations were introduced.
- Optional runtime checks (when scenes/prefabs are affected):
  - Open/run impacted scene path to verify prefab/script bindings survived the move.
  - Smoke test the migrated feature entry point only.

**PR evidence to include**
- Exact moved/touched paths (from legacy source to new module destination).
- Boundary checks and dependency notes after relocation.
- Migration notes: what moved, why it moved now, and any required follow-up.

**Failure handling**
- If full Unity runtime verification is unavailable, provide static relocation evidence (file moves + reference updates) and list pending runtime checks.
- Document missing tooling/dependencies and assign clear follow-up validation ownership.

**Migration note for legacy folders**
- Legacy folders may include: `camera/`, `config/`, `debug/`, `feedback/`, `fx/`, `gameplay/`, `localization/`, `meta/`, `monetisation/`, `scenemanagement/`, `services/`, `settings/`, `ui/`.
- When touching one of these modules, relocate **that touched module only** in the same change when safe.
- Target destinations: gameplay-driven systems → `Gameplay/`; presentation → `UI/`; platform/external integrations → `Services/`; minimal shared helpers/orchestration → `Core/`.
- Keep migration scoped: move files, update namespaces/references, preserve scene/prefab integrity, and verify no circular dependencies.
- Document what moved, why it moved, and any required follow-up in the PR notes.

## Legacy Module Scoped Migration Guard

### Intent
Provide a deterministic workflow that enforces scoped migration whenever a legacy module under `Assets/Scripts` is edited, while preserving module boundaries and Unity asset integrity.

### Scope boundaries
In scope:
- Changes that touch scripts/assets in legacy module paths under `Assets/Scripts`.
- Scoped relocation of only the touched legacy module into `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay`, `Assets/Scripts/UI`, `Assets/Scripts/Services`, or `Assets/Scripts/Core`.
- Namespace/reference updates and module-scoped verification.

Out of scope:
- Broad repo-wide restructures unrelated to the touched module.
- Refactors across untouched legacy folders.
- Behavioral rewrites beyond what is required to keep migration safe and compiling.

### Preconditions
- Identify each touched legacy folder (for example: `camera/`, `config/`, `debug/`, `feedback/`, `fx/`, `gameplay/`, `localization/`, `meta/`, `monetisation/`, `scenemanagement/`, `services/`, `settings/`, `ui/`).
- Choose a target module destination using the mapping rules below:
  - `camera/` → `Gameplay/` (when gameplay-driven).
  - `gameplay/` and gameplay `fx/` → `Gameplay/`.
  - `ui/` and presentation `feedback/` → `UI/`.
  - `services/` and `monetisation/` → `Services/`.
  - `localization/`, `scenemanagement/`, shared `config/`, shared `settings/`, and lightweight `meta/` utilities → `Core/` (or `Services/`/`UI/` only when responsibility is clearly service/presentation specific).
  - `debug/` utilities → `Core/` unless tightly coupled to one destination module.
- Confirm migration is safe and scoped to only currently touched modules.

### Steps
1. **Plan scoped relocation**
   - Record source→target moves for touched legacy paths only.
   - Keep directory depth and file naming stable where possible to reduce reference churn.
2. **Perform safe move playbook**
   - Move files and `.meta` files together to preserve Unity GUIDs.
   - Update namespaces to match the new module path.
   - Update all affected `using` directives, type references, asmdef references, and public API call sites.
   - Avoid changing serialized field names/types unless required; if required, add migration-safe attributes (`FormerlySerializedAs`) where applicable.
   - Do not delete or rewrite unrelated prefabs/scenes.
3. **Enforce boundary rules**
   - Remove any sibling-internal access introduced by the move.
   - Route cross-module communication through interfaces, events, or explicit public APIs.
   - Check for new circular dependencies before finalizing.
4. **Prepare PR migration summary**
   - Add a dedicated section named `Migration steps performed` using this template:

```md
### Migration steps performed
- Legacy module touched: `<path>`
- Destination chosen: `<Gameplay|UI|Services|Core>/<subpath>`
- Files moved: `<source>` → `<target>`
- Namespace/reference updates: `<summary>`
- Inspector/prefab/scene binding safeguards: `<what was preserved/checked>`
- Follow-up required: `<none or explicit item>`
```

5. **Run lightweight touched-module verification**
   - Compile-check only moved/edited scripts.
   - Verify namespace and reference resolution for touched modules.
   - Validate serialized field null-guards in changed components.
   - Smoke-check only impacted scenes/prefabs for binding continuity.
   - Document any blocked runtime verification with exact reason and next command for maintainers.

### Validation checklist
- [ ] Touched legacy module(s) were migrated to `Gameplay/`, `UI/`, `Services/`, or `Core/` when safe.
- [ ] Files + `.meta` moved together and namespaces/usings/references were updated.
- [ ] Prefab/scene inspector bindings were preserved (or explicitly repaired and documented).
- [ ] No sibling-internal module access exists after migration.
- [ ] Cross-module communication uses events/interfaces/public APIs.
- [ ] Verification was limited to touched modules and results were recorded.

### Rollback/safety notes
- If compilation or bindings fail, revert the move commit, restore original paths with matching `.meta` files, and re-apply migration in smaller scoped batches.
- Keep each legacy-module migration isolated so rollback can be done per module without affecting unrelated systems.
- Avoid simultaneous asset renames plus behavioral rewrites in one step; perform relocation first, then behavior changes.

### Example invocation
"Use **Legacy Module Scoped Migration Guard** while editing `Assets/Scripts/localization/LocaleProvider.cs`; move it under `Assets/Scripts/Core/Localization/`, update namespaces/usings, validate the touched localization flow, and include the `Migration steps performed` section in the PR."

## Quick start

1. Pick the relevant module group (Gameplay, UI, Services, Core, Cross-cutting).
2. Follow the group's **Do/Don't** boundaries before implementation.
3. Use events/interfaces/public APIs for all cross-module communication.
4. If touching a legacy folder, apply the scoped migration note in the same change when safe.
5. Validate only impacted modules and confirm no boundary/circular-dependency violations.
